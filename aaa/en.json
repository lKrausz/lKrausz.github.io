          "fullContent": "Calculating the volatility of a slot machine involves using complex mathematical models and needs to take into account a wide variety of factors. Some of the most important of those are the actual frequency of payouts and the average size of these payouts. Keep in mind The exact method of calculating volatility differs from one gaming provider to another, and sometimes even from one slot to another. The most common way to calculate a slot’s volatility involves looking at its RTP percentage and the standard deviation we see in payouts. While the RTP's meaning is extensively explained above, you should also know that the deviation of payouts is defined as a way of measuring how much prizes vary from the average. The volatility of the slot machine can be calculated by combining these two measures. A high-volatility slot machine has a higher standard deviation and a lower RTP, which means that players will win less frequently but will receive larger payouts when they do. A low-volatility slot machine will have a lower standard deviation and a higher RTP, implying that players will win more frequently but with smaller payouts."

High-volatility slots will put you on an emotional roller coaster governed by long losing streaks followed by substantial wins, while low-volatility games will keep you on your toes constantly with frequent, low-value wins. The way you choose the games you play does have an impact on the outcome of your sessions, and that is why it is always important to look at slot volatility and decide the level that is most appropriate for your playing style, expectations, and budget."
